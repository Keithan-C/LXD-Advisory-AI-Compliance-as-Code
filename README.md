# LXD Advisory: AI Compliance-as-Code
### *Automating EU AI Act Article 12 & 11 for Automotive and Industrial AI*

The **EU AI Act** (effective August 2, 2026) transforms AI compliance from a legal checkbox into a technical system requirement. For organizations developing ADAS, Automated Procurement, or Safety-Critical Simulation, manual documentation is a "Development Tax" that drains senior engineering hours and delays product launches.

**LXD Advisory** provides the architectural bridge to automate this process using **Artifact-as-Code**.

---

## 🚀 The Core Methodology: Artifact-as-Code
Instead of manual PDF reports, we implement **Technical Telemetry**. We integrate standardized schemas directly into your software middleware to generate audit-ready evidence in real-time.

* **Article 12 (Traceability):** Automatic logging of inference confidence, model versions, and logic paths.
* **Article 11 (Technical Documentation):** Real-time generation of the Technical File from system metadata.
* **Article 14 (Human Oversight):** Data-driven proof of manual override and oversight capabilities.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
This repository contains the baseline blueprints for our 3-week implementation pilot:

* **/schemas**: Standardized JSON Schemas for Article 12 compliance.
* **/examples**: A comparison between raw system logs and LXD-structured telemetry.
* **MAPPING_WORKSHEET.md**: The 2-hour integration guide for lead developers.

## 🛠 The 3-Week Implementation Pilot
We don't just consult; we deploy. Our pilot is designed to prove the automation model without disrupting your existing CI/CD velocity:

1.  **Week 1: Gap Analysis:** Identifying regulatory triggers in your specific AI stack.
2.  **Week 2: Mapping & Integration:** A 2-hour deep dive with your leads to map system variables to the LXD Schema.
3.  **Week 3: Automated Artifact Generation:** The first "Audit Defense Brief" generated automatically by your system.

---

## 📊 Business Value
* **90% Reduction** in manual documentation hours for senior engineering leads.
* **De-risked Launch:** Protect your 2026 production roadmap from regulatory blocks.
* **Audit Readiness:** Move from "Black Box" AI to structured, explainable telemetry that satisfies EU regulators and ISO 26262/ASPICE assessors.
